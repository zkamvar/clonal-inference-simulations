## Introduction

We've shown that clone-correction can reduce the power of $\bar{r}_d$ to detect
clonal reproduction, but it's also clear that a reduced sample size contributes
to this as well. To disentangle this, we assess the $\bar{r}_d$ from 1000 
replicates of *n* samples where *n* is the size of the data set after 
clone-correction. The data were processed via the `analyze_jackknife_ia.R`
script. These were saved in the `ma_jack_rda_files/` directory.


## Setup
